#For this program to run successfully, we need to use two library, smtplib and random. Random is a pre-installed library but smtplib has to be installed externally.
#To install smtplib, open command prompt and type: 'pip install smtplib'
#Library will be installed
import smtplib
import random

#'no' will be the program generated OTP which will be mailed to the user
no=random.randint(100000,999999)

#'no' should be converted into string format.
no=str(no)

#Let's prepare the text which has to be mailed to user.
text="DEAR USER,\nYOUR OTP TO RESET YOUR ACCOUNT PIN IS "+no+"\nREGARDS,\nYASHGUPTA-CODER."

#'text' is again converted into string to be confirmed (can be ignored)
text=str(text)

#In the following code, 'a' is the sender's email ID and 'b' is the sender's email password.
server.login('a','b')

#In the following code, 'a' is the sender's email ID and 'c' is the receiver's email ID.
server.sendmail('a','c',text)
server.quit()
#Mail has been successfully sent. If any error, mail us on: yashg7838@gmail.com

#Now we have to check OTP so let's convert 'no' into integer.

#Let us take the OTP from the user
